<H1>Article and Chapter Overviews of SEM</h1>

While there are many whole <A HREF="HTTP://www.gsu.edu/~mkteer/bookfaq.html">books</A> available on the topic of structural equation modeling (SEM), some researchers may prefer a briefer introduction to the field.  The following articles and book chapters have been recommended as good overviews of the field.  However, readers are advised to be aware of publication dates.  SEM is a fast-moving field, and old recommendations may be obsolete.<p>

I have recently written an overview chapter on SEM:<BR>
Rigdon, E.E. (1998). Structural equation modeling. In G. Marcoulides (ed.), Modern methods for business research.  Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, pp. 251-94.<BR>
This book also includes chapters on partial least squares and latent class analysis--alternatives to SEM--and on longitudinal modeling and dynamic factor analysis.<P>

<HR>

Jodie Ullman wrote a chapter on SEM for:<BR>
Using multivariate statistics (3rd ed.) by Tabachnick and Fidell--HarperCollins, pp. 709-812.<BR>
Jodie states, "The chapter is very much an intro and overview of SEM  along with demonstration of SEM models using EQS, LISREL, CALIS, and RAMONA."<P>
